     <h3>Background</h3>

       <p> I was born and raised in Newcastle Washington, the east side of Lake Washington, on the edge of suburban America with two brothers and one sister.  I graduated high school in Renton to long ago to remember the year.  After highschool I kicked around; did some college, joined the Army,rode a motorcycle back and forth across the country, went back and finished college, did some more Army, went back finished my masters, and finally landed back in Seattle in the 90's.  I'm married with children.  My lovely partner and I have raised six children.  I enjoy physical activity, gardening, studying history, and spending time with my family.  For the last 20 years I've worked in affordable housing development; that is helping build affordable rental housing for families and seniors.  I've worked with non-profit housing providers, non-profit service organizations, and public agencies, all with the common goal of trying to meet the need for housing that is affordable.
